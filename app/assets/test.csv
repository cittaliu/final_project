Send an email to DPCAlumni@outlook.com. San Diego Data Processing Corporation (SDDPC) was created by The City of San Diego in 1979 to provide a vehicle outside of the City\u2019s wage and hour structure to insure that the City had the best and brightest people to manage The City of San Diego Data communications infrastructure. Over the years, SDDPC managed nearly all aspects of that data infrastructure including voice and data communications, programs and processes, and coordination of activities that impacted the applications that the various City departments used. SDDPC demonstrated tremendous skills in applications development for various programs in support of City government and those applications were used by many municipalities. In addition, SDDPC had tremendous capabilities in purchasing and contracting and supported other Cities besides San Diego in this area as well. In 2010 The City of San Diego decided to move in a new direction and ultimately put out an RFP to allow others to bid on the activities that SDDPC had been performing on behalf of the City. That bid process resulted in an award to 3 different vendors for the work SDDPC had been performing. Xerox was awarded the telecommunications component of the ongoing work, Atos was awarded the data center component, and CGI was awarded the applications component. The City then substantially increased the DoIT staff to manage these three vendors. These awards resulted in the decision to close SDDPC on or about December 31, 2013. While we are disappointed with that decision, we take pride in our accomplishments as an organization and want to thank the thousands of dedicated employees through the years that made it all possible. We want to thank the City of San Diego and all the fine public servants who were our customers through the years."

According to Gartner, virtualization has surpassed 70 percent of all x86 server workloads. Based on the proven benefits of virtualization at the server level, organizations have started to also virtualize their networks. Gartner predicts that by the end of 2016, more than 10,000 enterprises worldwide will have deployed Software-defined Networks (SDN), a tenfold increase from end-of-year 2014. As virtualization adoption expands to include the network layer, organizations still need to enforce the same security, compliance, and governance policies that they do in traditional compute and network environments. This creates a challenge for the traditional perimeter model. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and SDN introduce the separation of the data plane from the control plane. Perimeter controls also sit outside the virtual fabric, which prevents them from visualizing and securing traffic between virtual machines (the so-called east-west traffic). With security threats on the rise and attack techniques becoming more and more sophisticated, securing your virtual infrastructure from within has become a requirement. Catbird\u00ae is a pioneer and leader in software-defined security for virtual infrastructure. Catbird\u2019s software suite of products was designed from the ground up to provide visibility into and protection of private clouds and virtual Data Centers, and is available for both VMware and OpenStack.

As there are factors outside of your control like budgetary constraints, workload, threats, infrastructures, culture, and so on.
